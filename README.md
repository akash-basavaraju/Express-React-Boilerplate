# Express-React-Boilerplate
This is a Simple Express React Boilerplate.\
The React App is created using `create-react-app` and Express App is created using `express-generator`. Both the React App and Express App are wired for the hot-reloading development.
## Some of the npm commands are as follows :
`npm run boilerInit` - this installs the npm packages in express as well as React App\
`npm run dev` - this command starts the development server of both React and Express
